Carrom v1.0 is intended to be a simple single player game made primarily made using
openGL, GLUT and C++11 technologies.					

How to Play
To play the game
1. Using Keyboard. ’a’ and ’c’ - rotate striker, ’up’ and ’down’ to change power, ’left’ and
’right’ to position the striker, ’spacebar’ to shoot.
2. Using mouse, Drag striker using right button and hold left mouse button to aim and release
to shoot
3. pressing 'r' would set all the coins and striker as they should be after they stopped after colliding.



You need to pocket the gray coins and blue coin in the given time limit initially 30 seconds.

You lose 5 seconds for pocketing the grey ones and the striker. You gain 10 seconds by pocketing
blue coins and 50 seconds by pocketing the red one.
The striker will reset if you pocket it or it slows down. But the other coins need not be static.
The timer will be halted while a shoot is in progress. Be aware that the coins may hit your striker
and cause you to unable to shoot.The pocketed coins stack outside the board.

Programming Approarch
I have used a Object Oriented Programming Paradigm. The Coin and Striker classes contain 
attributes and functions on how to operate on them like draw them, move them etc. Function
Overloading and C++ templating has been used where necessary. 

The Board class holds the game logic, attributes and board drawing elements.

The header files contain the various declarations of the classes and specifically 'constants.h’
contains all the global game parameters which can be changed easily.
